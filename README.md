# Using Generative Adversarial Networks for inversion of Geophysical data

This project explores the feasability of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's) in the pipeline for solving Geophysical problems. This is an extension on the work done by  <cite>[Laloy et al., 2019][1]</cite>. Laloy in his paper explores the fesability
